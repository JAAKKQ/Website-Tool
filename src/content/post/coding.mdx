### NodeJS Vinyl Manager
Created this because I wanted keep track of my records. Also when buying new records I had to make sure I did not have that album or song already. With this I could solve my problem easily.

If I want to listen to a certain song I can just write it's name on the search and then easily find it from my by genre organized shelf of albums.
